CODE REFACTOR


This project has been refactored from the original to improve the code

The code has been refactored to include semantic elements 

CSS has been commented out


HTML

The title has been renamed to be more specific to the company website

The links in the nav bar work as well as the Search Engine Optimization link which has been fixed to correctly link to the main section when clicked on

All images have been given an alt description


CSS

elements which have the same style have been consolidated into classes to improve reader view 

while rainstorming in a study group I was introduced to scroll behavior. i added scroll-behavior: smooth to give the page a nice effect of a clean transition when clicking the links in the navigation bar
